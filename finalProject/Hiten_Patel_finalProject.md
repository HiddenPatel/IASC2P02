# Abstract 

Education is a constantly changing and fluctuating topic as over the years there have been many factors that have changed the outcome and value of students from each year. The factors could be budget, how many teachers, the average gdp of each year and many others. Does digital humanities also affect the education system? Computers and technology have also been a major part of modern education. Research tools such as Voyant tools have been used to collect and sort data from datahub.io. To see if digital research tools are effective in finding research potential of a digital tool and how it shapes our ability, in the humanities, to make durable claims.


# Introduction 

The education system has changed many times as time has passed. The average gdp in the United States of America changes over the years and we want to see as to what is influencing this phenomena. We wanted to see what was the influence of the difference of gdp each year from the rest. Was it the United States budget separation? Was the spread of the United States budget affects the GDP in the education system, we will find all of that out using Voyant tools, a digital research software that allows sorting data into a graph and links. Voyant tools also create its own links from the word counts as it creates associations and connections to make a theme from the data or texts. My hypothesis based on the information given to me, I believe that if the higher the budget in education the quality of better teachers and with more higher quality teachers and facilities and content for students I believe a higher GDP will occur in the years which the American government spent more money in education

# Methodology 

The apparatus and materials used in this experiment were Voyant tools, CIRP Freshman Survey, US education budget analysis, Matthew’s Article, these were used in this experiment to determine if research digital software is able to create a good depiction and analysis on the data and information that it was given and creates a weblink with the most common/ most used word in the text or data file. The procedure that was done to complete this experiment was to first take all of the data from US education analysis and from CIRP Freshman survey, store the data files in a readable text file for Voyant tools to read. Then the readable data is then put into the software for it to calculate the word count of the designated data. This was done to all of the data texts and articles used to create graphs and term links.

The data is coming from the CIPR Freshman Survey that the US did too analysis the way the budget of the united states was allocating their yearly budget. Specifically the total budget USA allocated to education over the year. Voyant tools sorted out the survey data an pulled out the key components



## Processing and Tool Use 

The tools used to proccess the data was Voyant as Voyant Tools is a web-based software for text analysis and visualization. It allows users to upload text documents and analyze them using a variety of tools such as word frequency analysis, document clustering, and keyword in context (KWIC) analysis. Voyant Tools also provides interactive visualizations that help users to explore and understand patterns in the text data. The software is designed to be user-friendly and accessible to researchers, students, and anyone interested in exploring text data. It is widely used in digital humanities, literary studies, and social sciences research.


# Results 

On average every year the military/ defense forces and the health services get the most amount of budget that the US uses. Education is often the 3rd or 4th most for the money spent, sometimes even less. However in 2009 there was an abnormal jump compared to the rest of the years. There was a steady increase over the years. 

# Analysis 

From these findings we have found that digital research tools are able to create a new way to analyze data and find unique information that you would not easily find from just reading a text or taking the data at face value. Digital research tools give a unbiased point of you which is valuable in an unbiased lab report or creating valid information that does not come from a personal opinion which can have false information or give an incorrect reading of the data that was given.  


# Discussion 

This means that the more of the yearly budget in the united states is focused on the miltary rather then health and education which makes no sense during a time of peace where wars was not occuring which the United States could have.

The CIPR Freshman survey result were put into voyant tool to sort out the raw database 
The United states of America education budget results were put into the voyant tool to sort out the raw database
The 2 database information was compared to the “what is digital humanities and what’s it doing in the english department?” article.
Analyzed each of the graphs to compare the way the US government used their budget each year 
On average every year the military/ defense forces and the health services get the most amount of budget that the US uses. Education is often the 3rd or 4th most for the amount of money spent, sometimes even less. 
However in 2009 when education did get the most it was the year with the highest gdp
